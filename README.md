# PHP MVC SQL Framework

This is a custom-built MVC framework written in PHP, primarily designed for use with Microsoft SQL Server.

This framework, while still incomplete provides the following functionality:

- Page Routing
- Ability to connect to an SQL Server instance
- Dynamic view creation
- CSS webpage theme support *(Incomplete)*
- Form generation from Database tables
- Other small features which will be detailed in the future

**Note:**
The code for the framework is not currently available. It will be pushed at a later date once some bugs have been fixed and some slightly more versatile code has been developed for some core features.

However, the API documentation is available for viewing here on [GitHub Pages](https://mr-kaos.github.io/PHP-MVC-SQL-Framework).

This API doc will be updated as the framework develops.
